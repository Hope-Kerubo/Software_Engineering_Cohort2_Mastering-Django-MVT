Python: Students should have Python 3.x installed on their computers. You should provide instructions on how to install Python or direct them to relevant resources.

Django: Students need to install Django, and you should specify the required version for your course. Provide installation instructions or point them to Django's official documentation.

Version Control: Familiarity with Git and a Git client (e.g., Git Bash, GitHub Desktop) is recommended. It will help students manage their code and collaborate with others.

A stable internet connection is necessary for downloading software, accessing course materials, participating in discussions, and seeking help online.

HTML and CSS: Basic understanding of HTML for web page structure and CSS for styling is helpful but not required.

Basic Database Concepts: Familiarity with relational databases and SQL concepts is beneficial for understanding Django's database interactions.
